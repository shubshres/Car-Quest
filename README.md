# CarQuest

## Inspiration

Signing up for car insurance can be a scary process, especially as a first time car buyer. We wanted to make the process as fun and informative as possible. 

## What it does

Our application takes in information needed by State Farm in order to generate a quote for the price of car insurance, and informs the user on how each piece of information impacts the cost, and why it is necessary. 

## How we built it

We utilized Angular to build the front end of the application, and Figma for prototyping and design. 

## Challenges we ran into

We ran into issues trying to add animations into our project.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud of everything we were able to accomplish in 24 hours

## What we learned

Some of our team members learned how to use Angular for the first time

We also learned how to use stepper with Angular's Material UI
